# cutie

cutie is an opinionated go code generator for database models born out of a zealous drive to enforce separation and types for maintainability and testability. It is still a work in progress.

It's core design can be found in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Present capabilities

cutie currently supports the generation of the database models from PostgresSQL schemas with [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) along with mocks with [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock). At present, cutie expects users to supply their own application and API models. The future plan of cutie is to also generate protobuf messages for API and integrate with the models from the other layers.

## Components

### pg_dump

pg_dump produces the SQL schema required for sqlc to generate model code. The lack of migration engine means cutie can work with existing databases created by any migration engines, and continue to be agnostic of related tools.

### sqlc

sqlc generates type-safe go model and query code from raw SQL. This might be preferred over ORM as it ensures not only the models but also the query parameters are type-checked.

### gomock

gomock creates mock implementations of the query interfaces generated by sqlc.
